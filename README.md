# CATALYST PROJECT: Are high-income neighborhoods generally farther away from significant greenhouse gas emissions?

Welcome to my repository!

This repository stores the code and data I used to produce the scatterplots shown on my slideshow, note that these are edited versions. My code is under 'catalyst.py', the greenhouse gas emission data is 'ghgp_data_2021.csv', and the median household income data is 'zip_code_income_edit.csv'

## SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR API USERS

Add a file named `config.py` and store your API keys in variables within this file. `config.py` has already been added to the `.gitignore` file.

Add an `import config` to the top of your programs in order to use the API key. This will prevent the API key from being published to the web. You can then use the API key in your file by accessing the variable inside the config module, for example `config.my_api_key`.

When using the requests library, you might need to `pip install requests`. If your computer complains about permissions, try installing for the user using `python -m pip install -user requests` on Windows or `pip install --user requests` on Mac.
